Training Session Data Issue Notes:

011 - training session 7 appears to have been run as T6. Unknown which previous .mat file was used to run T7. stimOrderLog_st11b6 is identical to stimOrderLog_st11b7

034 - there were two Training 6's (6/23 and 6/25) and no Training 7. Renamed the second T6 (6/25) as T7. There is no stopsig.log for T7.

038 - There is no stimOrderLog.mat , stimOrderLog.txt , or stopsig.log for training session 7. There is, however, a train7.mat ... unknown what happened to the other files as they are not on the computer where the participant was run, nor backed-up to dropbox.

060 GNG1 was run as GNG3. Changed output file name, but GNG1 is still labeled GNG3 in the files themselves.

062 only completed 9 training sessions
